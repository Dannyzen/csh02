CS for Hackers
==============

## Course intro

Goal: give you a map of the big ideas in computer science.  Selected some, but
not all topics, based on what we thought is useful.

Reasoning: since you're hackers already, let's take an ordered approach, since
we don't have to teach you the basics of programming. Different from how a
university would approach it:

## Weeks

1. [Week 1 - Systems Architecture](https://github.com/generalassembly/cs-for-hackers/tree/master/week-01)

### Week 2 - Operating Systems

How does software make use of the hardware? What facilities does the OS offer
and how do our favoraite languges/libraries make use of them?

Instructor
:   Heewa Barfchin (Chartbeat)
Location
:   Village Ventures

### Week 3 - Data Structures and Algorithms 
### Week 4 - Data Structures and Algorithms

Given finite time and space in the hardware, how do we effectively get stuff
done? This is the collected wisdom of systems builders over 59 years (for hash
tables, 57 for linked lists, or 170 years from the first program).

Instructors
:   Tom Arcidiacono (Bloomberg), Detlef Ronneburger (Bloomberg)
Location
:   Bloomberg

### Week 5 - Theory of Computation

Theory of computation: Beyond our finite hardware, what is computable or not?
What general things can we learn about how hard problems are? How can we know?
Topics: Formal models of computing, Complexity Theory, important complexity
classes, and reductions to known problems. 

Instructor
:   Jon Napolitano (Google)
Location
:   GeneralAssemb.ly

### Week 6 - Programming Languages Theory

Great, we know what is computable, but what forms of expression are useful in
translating our desires so machines can carry them out? Topics: Historical
problems and the language features that solve them. Type, scope, closure,
dynamism, polymorphism, higher order functions, optimizations, JIT, etc.

### Week 7 - Programming Languages Implementation

What's involved in implementing a programming language? Topics: lexing,
parsing, optimization, JIT, etc.

Instructor
:   Heewa Barfchin (Chartbeat)
Location
:   GeneralAssemb.ly

### Week 8 - Concurrency and the failure of Moore's Law

What happened to Moore's Law? How do we keep making performance progress in the
face of core limits? Topics: shared memory models, threads, locking, actor
models, the c10k problem, asynchronous IO, vector clocks, consensus algorithms,
etc.

Instructor
:    Ryan Witt (Opani)
Location
:    GeneralAssemb.ly


### Week 9 - Machine Learning 
### Week 10 - Machine Learning

Machine learning: How do we get computers to figure out the structure of
problems for us? Can computers deliver insights to us, rather than the other
way around?  Topics: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (State spaces
and search, probability and bayes networks, planning, supervised learning,
regression, overfitting, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning)

## Class Format

### Wednesday
- hour 1 - Lecture part 1
- hour 2 - Lab: Work on hacking challenge, ask questions of TA/Instructor.
  Cover additional topics requested by students.

### Monday
- hour 3 - Lab: Demo project from previous week to TA/Instructor
- hour 4 - Lecture part 2, introduce next week's assignment.

## Hacking Challenges

This course has assignments. Since we're all hackers, we'll use this fact to
help us learn. These are not hand-holding homeworks like you might have had in
college, they are challenges designed to help you really understand what we are
discussing in class. They will test your creativity and ingenuity, rather than
the ability to conform to a spec.  After all, the goal is to learn something
useful!

Assignments are given out at the end of class, and you have until the beginning
of the next lecture to turn them in.  Might be good to take advantage of the
weekend in-between!

## TAs

There are one or more TAs to help you with understanding the assignments.
They've solved the problem in their own way, and have a solid backround in CS.
They'll help you think through the problem (but not complete the challenge for
you).
