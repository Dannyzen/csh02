# CS For Hackers - Week 1 - Systems Architecture

Instructor: [Ryan Witt](http://twitter.com/onecreativenerd), [Opani](http://opani.com/)

Location: Village Ventures

You have to know the hardware in order to understand how the software behaves. This
will be a theme through the rest of the class, and we'll come back to the
points we learn this week. Topics: Binary logic and the physics of
implementation, parts of a computer and how they interact, understanding the
speed order of magnitude of each part, computing as a hierarchy of caches,
cache locality.

## Lectures

1. [Lecture 1](https://github.com/generalassembly/cs-for-hackers/blob/master/week-01/lecture1.md): What is a computer? From digital logic to the ALU.
2. Lecture 2: System dynamics, cache locality and branch prediciton.
