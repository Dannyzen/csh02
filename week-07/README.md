## Hacking Challenge

WORM

Assignment: Implement a virtual machine (like python) that can run worm bytecode. I've provided an assembler (wiggle.py) and separately a reference file (wormassembly.py) that explains the register layout and instructions you need to support. There's also a sample file (language.txt) of some assembly code (that you can convert to bytecode with wiggle.py).
